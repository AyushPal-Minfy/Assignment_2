In this task, I created a simple webpage using HTML and CSS and followed GitHub Flow with two feature branches. The first branch, feature/update-styling, modified and the Second branch, 
feature/add-content, added new content. After making commits to both branches, I created pull requests for each. When trying to merge the branches, I encountered a merge conflict
because both branches modified the same part of the file. To resolve the conflict, I manually merged the changes, combined both content updates, and committed the resolved file. 
Both branches were successfully merged after the conflict resolution.
